<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to design an interactive course on English Language Arts for Grade 6 California curriculum. The requirements are:
1. Topics: Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, English Writing
2. Grade 6 California curriculum level
3. Web interface
4. Progress tracking
5. Navigation through course chapters

This is a complex task that will require:
- Setting up a web application
- Creating course content structure
- Implementing progress tracking
- Building an interactive UI
- Organizing content by chapters/sections

I should start by creating a TODO list for this task, then begin implementation. I'll use a modern web framework like React for the frontend and structure the content appropriately.

Let me think about the architecture:
- Frontend: React with routing for navigation
- State management: Local storage or a simple state management solution for progress tracking
- Content structure: JSON or structured data for course content
- Styling: Modern CSS (maybe Tailwind or similar)
- Backend: Could be optional initially, use local storage for progress

Let me create a comprehensive TODO list and start building.</details></think>

I'll help you design and build an interactive English Language Arts course for Grade 6 California curriculum. This will be a comprehensive web-based learning platform with progress tracking and chapter navigation.

Let me start by creating a structured plan for this project:

_**User (2025-12-23 20:02Z)**_

Now in the next step, I want to add more chapters to each of the Modules but we have to ensure these are grade 6 California difficulty level



Lets start we vocabulary first

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to expand the course content by adding more chapters to each module, starting with Vocabulary. They want to ensure the content remains at Grade 6 California curriculum difficulty level.

I should:
1. Research/think about appropriate Grade 6 California vocabulary topics
2. Add more chapters to the Vocabulary module in the courseData.js file
3. Ensure the content is age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned
4. Include both lessons and exercises for each new chapter

For Grade 6 Vocabulary in California, typical topics include:
- Figurative language (similes, metaphors, idioms)
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Homophones and homographs
- Connotation vs denotation
- Academic vocabulary
- Multiple meaning words
- Prefixes and suffixes (expanding on roots)

Let me add several new chapters to the Vocabulary module that are engaging and appropriate for Grade 6 students.</details></think>

At the 6th-grade level in California, the focus shifts from basic "sight words" to academic vocabulary (words used across different subjects) and domain-specific vocabulary (words used in science, history, or literature).Here is a breakdown of the core vocabulary areas aligned with California Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Grade 6.1. High-Frequency Academic Vocabulary (Tier 2)These are words you will see in textbooks, on tests, and in formal writing.WordDefinitionExampleAnalyzeTo examine something in detail to understand it better.Analyze the character’s motives in the story.ContextThe circumstances or setting surrounding an event or statement.Use context clues to find the meaning of the word.EvaluateTo judge or determine the significance or worth of something.Evaluate the effectiveness of the author's argument.InterpretTo explain the meaning of information or actions.How do you interpret the ending of the poem?SignificantSufficiently great or important to be worthy of attention.The discovery of fire was a significant event in history.SummarizeTo give a brief statement of the main points.Summarize the first chapter in three sentences.2. Greek and Latin Roots & AffixesGrade 6 is a big year for "word parts." Understanding these helps you "unlock" the meaning of thousands of unfamiliar words.Bio (Life): Biology, Biography, BiosphereGraph (Write): Autograph, Paragraph, GraphicTele (Far): Telescope, Telephone, TelevisionMicro (Small): Microscope, Microbiome, MicrowavePre- (Before): Prefix, Predict, PrepareAnti- (Against): Antidote, Antisocial, Antiseptic3. Figurative Language & Literary TermsCalifornia standards require students to identify and use nuances in word meanings.Simile: A comparison using "like" or "as" (e.g., Quiet as a mouse).Metaphor: A direct comparison without using like/as (e.g., The snow is a white blanket).Personification: Giving human qualities to non-human things (e.g., The wind whistled).Hyperbole: An extreme exaggeration (e.g., I've told you a million times).Connotation: The feeling a word gives you (e.g., "Youthful" vs. "Childish").4. How to PracticeTo master these, I recommend the "Context, Clue, Connect" method:Context: Read the word in a full sentence.Clue: Look for prefixes or suffixes you recognize.Connect: Try to use the word in a sentence about your own life.Since you mentioned your interest in Grade 6 California standards.

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to add more content to the Vocabulary module based on California Common Core State Standards for Grade 6. They've provided specific vocabulary areas:

1. High-Frequency Academic Vocabulary (Tier 2) - words like analyze, context, evaluate, interpret, significant, summarize
2. Greek and Latin Roots & Affixes - more comprehensive than what I already have
3. Figurative Language & Literary Terms - I have similes and metaphors, but need to add personification and hyperbole
4. The "Context, Clue, Connect" method for practice

I should:
1. Add a new chapter or expand existing chapters with Tier 2 academic vocabulary
2. Expand the Greek and Latin roots chapter with the examples they provided
3. Add personification and hyperbole to the figurative language chapter
4. Include the practice method they mentioned

Let me update the courseData.js file to incorporate this content appropriately.</details></think>

Perfect! I'll integrate this California Common Core-aligned content into the Vocabulary module. Let me add these important Grade 6 academic vocabulary concepts to the appropriate chapters.

Lets add chapters to grammer module based on below details:

In 6th grade, California’s grammar standards (CCSS) shift from basic sentence structure to the conventions of standard English that make writing more precise and sophisticated. The biggest focus this year is on pronouns and sentence variety.



Here are the key pillars of 6th-grade grammar in California:

1. Mastery of Pronouns

This is arguably the most important grammar goal for 6th graders. You are expected to:

Case: Ensure pronouns are in the proper case:

Subjective: I, he, she, we, they (The person doing the action).

Objective: Me, him, her, us, them (The person receiving the action).

Possessive: My, his, hers, ours, theirs.

Intensive Pronouns: Use pronouns like myself, ourselves, and themselves to add emphasis (e.g., "I did the homework myself.").

Vague Antecedents: Avoid "vague" pronouns where it's unclear who you are talking about.

Vague: "Sarah and Jane went to the store, and she bought milk." (Who is she?)

Correct: "Sarah and Jane went to the store; Sarah bought milk."

2. Punctuation for Clarity

California standards emphasize using punctuation to manage "extra" information in a sentence.

Parenthetical Elements: Use commas, parentheses, or dashes to set off non-essential information.

Example: "The principal**, Mr. Smith,** gave a speech."

Coordinate Adjectives: Use commas to separate adjectives that describe the same noun in an equal way.

Example: "It was a long, exhausting day." (You can tell they are coordinate because you could say "long and exhausting").

3. Sentence Patterns and Style

By 6th grade, the goal is to stop writing "choppy" sentences and start varying your style.

Simple, Compound, and Complex Sentences: You should be able to move between these to show how ideas relate.

Consistency: Maintain a consistent style and tone. If you start a formal essay, you shouldn't suddenly use slang or "text speak."

4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Grade 6 is the year to "clean up" common errors:

Pronoun Shifts: Don't switch from "I" to "you" or "one" in the middle of a paragraph.

Misplaced Modifiers: Ensure descriptive phrases are next to the word they describe.

Incorrect: "I saw a dog wearing a hat walking down the street." (Was the hat walking down the street?)

Correct: "While walking down the street, I saw a dog wearing a hat."

Grammar Check-In

Which of these sounds most challenging to you right now?

Choosing between "I" and "me" in complex sentences.

Knowing when to use a comma vs. a dash.

Understanding the difference between a phrase and a clause.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to add chapters to the Grammar module based on California 6th grade grammar standards. The key areas are:

1. Mastery of Pronouns
   - Case (subjective, objective, possessive)
   - Intensive pronouns (myself, ourselves, themselves)
   - Vague antecedents

2. Punctuation for Clarity
   - Parenthetical elements (commas, parentheses, dashes)
   - Coordinate adjectives

3. Sentence Patterns and Style
   - Simple, compound, and complex sentences
   - Consistency in style and tone

4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
   - Pronoun shifts
   - Misplaced modifiers

I should add several new chapters to the grammar module to cover these topics comprehensively. Let me read the current grammar content and then add appropriate chapters.</details></think>

+                 introduction: "Beyond basic pronoun case, Grade 6 students must master intensive pronouns for emphasis and ensure all pronouns have clear antecedents (the nouns they refer to).",
+                 explanation: "**Intensive Pronouns (Adding Emphasis)**\n\nIntensive pronouns add emphasis to a noun or pronoun:\n- **Forms**: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves\n\n**Examples:**\n- I did the homework **myself**. (I did it, no one else)\n- The principal **herself** announced the winners. (emphasizes it was the principal, not someone else)\n- We built the treehouse **ourselves**. (emphasizes we did it without help)\n\n**Key Rule**: Intensive pronouns emphasize who did something. They are NOT required for the sentence to make sense.\n- Test: Remove the intensive pronoun - the sentence still works.\n- \"I did the homework\" still makes sense without \"myself.\"\n\n**Common Mistake:**\n- Wrong: \"Myself and Tom went to the game.\"\n- Right: \"Tom and I went to the game.\" (Don't use 'myself' as a subject!)\n\n---\n\n**Clear Antecedents (Avoiding Vague Pronouns)**\n\nAn **antecedent** is the noun that a pronoun refers to. Every pronoun must have a clear antecedent!\n\n**Problem: Vague Pronoun Reference**\nWhen it's unclear who or what a pronoun refers to:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Vague**: \"Sarah and Jane went to the store, and **she** bought milk.\"\n  - Problem: Who is \"she\"? Sarah or Jane?\n- **Clear**: \"Sarah and Jane went to the store, and **Sarah** bought milk.\"\n- **Better**: \"Sarah and Jane went to the store; Sarah bought milk.\"\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Vague**: \"After I put the vase on the shelf, **it** broke.\"\n  - Problem: What broke? The vase or the shelf?\n- **Clear**: \"After I put the vase on the shelf, **the vase** broke.\"\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Vague**: \"In the article, **they** say pollution is increasing.\"\n  - Problem: Who is \"they\"?\n- **Clear**: \"In the article, **scientists** say pollution is increasing.\"\n\n**Rules for Clear Pronouns:**\n1. Make sure every pronoun clearly refers to ONE specific noun\n2. When in doubt, repeat the noun instead of using a pronoun\n3. Place pronouns close to their antecedents\n4. Avoid using \"they\" without a clear antecedent",

+                 explanation: "**Parenthetical Elements (Non-Essential Information)**\n\nParenthetical elements are extra pieces of information that can be removed without changing the basic meaning of the sentence. You can set them off with:\n- **Commas** (most common)\n- **Parentheses** (for very extra information)\n- **Dashes** (for emphasis)\n\n**Using Commas for Parenthetical Elements:**\n\n**Example 1: Appositives (Renaming Phrases)**\n- The principal**, Mr. Smith,** gave a speech.\n- My friend**, the one with red hair,** loves soccer.\n- California**, the Golden State,** is known for its beaches.\n\n**Example 2: Non-Essential Clauses**\n- My teacher**, who has taught for 20 years,** is very experienced.\n- The movie**, which won three awards,** was excellent.\n\n**Test**: Remove the information between commas - does the sentence still make sense?\n- \"The principal gave a speech.\" ✓ Still works!\n\n**Using Parentheses:**\nFor information that's really \"extra\" or an aside:\n- The test **(which covers chapters 1-5)** is on Friday.\n- My dog **(a golden retriever)** loves to swim.\n\n**Using Dashes:**\nFor information you want to emphasize:\n- The winner**—my best friend—**was announced on stage.\n- The assignment**—the most difficult one yet—**is due Monday.\n\n---\n\n**Coordinate Adjectives**\n\nCoordinate adjectives are two or more adjectives that **equally** describe the same noun. Use commas to separate them.\n\n**The Test**: Can you:\n1. Put \"and\" between the adjectives? AND\n2. Reverse the order?\n\nIf YES to both, use a comma!\n\n**Examples:**\n- It was a long**, **exhausting day.\n  - Test: \"long and exhausting day\" ✓ | \"exhausting, long day\" ✓\n  - Use comma!\n\n- She is a talented**, **dedicated student.\n  - Test: \"talented and dedicated\" ✓ | \"dedicated, talented\" ✓\n  - Use comma!\n\n**When NOT to Use a Comma:**\nIf adjectives are not coordinate (one modifies the other):\n\n- I bought a small red car.\n  - Test: \"small and red car\"? Sounds awkward.\n  - Test: \"red small car\"? Sounds wrong.\n  - NO comma! \"Small\" modifies \"red car\" as a unit.\n\n- She wore a beautiful silk dress.\n  - Test: \"beautiful and silk\"? Doesn't work.\n  - NO comma! \"Beautiful\" modifies \"silk dress.\"",

+                 explanation: "**Three Types of Sentences:**\n\n**1. Simple Sentence**\nOne independent clause (one complete thought):\n- **Structure**: Subject + Verb\n- Example: The dog barked.\n- Example: Maria and Tom played basketball after school. (still simple - one main action)\n\n**2. Compound Sentence**\nTwo or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS: **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o):\n- **Structure**: Independent Clause **+ comma + FANBOYS +** Independent Clause\n- Example: The dog barked**, and** the cat ran away.\n- Example: I studied hard**, yet** I still felt nervous.\n\n**Key Rule**: Use a comma BEFORE the conjunction!\n\n**3. Complex Sentence**\nOne independent clause + one or more dependent clauses:\n- **Structure**: Independent Clause + Dependent Clause (or reversed)\n- Example: **Because** it was raining, we stayed inside. (dependent, independent)\n- Example: We stayed inside **because** it was raining. (independent, dependent)\n\n**Common Subordinating Conjunctions** (start dependent clauses):\n- Time: when, while, before, after, until, since\n- Cause: because, since, as\n- Condition: if, unless, whether\n- Contrast: although, though, even though, while\n\n**Punctuation Rule for Complex Sentences:**\n- If dependent clause comes FIRST → use comma\n  - **When** I finish homework**, **I'll watch TV.\n- If independent clause comes FIRST → usually no comma\n  - I'll watch TV **when** I finish homework.\n\n---\n\n**Why Vary Sentence Types?**\n\n1. **Avoid Choppy Writing:**\n   - Choppy: \"I woke up. I ate breakfast. I went to school. I saw my friend.\"\n   - Better: \"When I woke up, I ate breakfast before going to school, where I saw my friend.\"\n\n2. **Show Relationships Between Ideas:**\n   - Simple: States a fact\n   - Compound: Shows equal ideas or contrast\n   - Complex: Shows cause/effect, time, or condition\n\n3. **Create Rhythm:**\n   Mix short and long sentences for variety!\n\n**Example of Good Variety:**\n\"The storm began suddenly. (simple) Dark clouds rolled in, and lightning flashed across the sky. (compound) Although we were scared, we stayed calm and found shelter. (complex) We were safe. (simple)\"",

+                 introduction: "Grade 6 is the year to clean up common errors. Two major pitfalls are pronoun shifts (switching person) and misplaced modifiers (descriptive phrases in the wrong place).",
+                 explanation: "**Problem 1: Pronoun Shifts**\n\nA pronoun shift occurs when you inconsistently change the person (I, you, one, he, they) you're using.\n\n**Types of Person:**\n- **First person**: I, we, me, us, my, our\n- **Second person**: you, your, yours\n- **Third person**: he, she, it, they, him, her, them, one\n\n**The Rule**: Be consistent! Don't switch persons in the middle of writing.\n\n**Example 1: I → You Shift**\n- **Wrong**: \"When **I** study for a test, **you** should start several days early.\"\n  - Problem: Shifts from first person (I) to second person (you)\n- **Right**: \"When **I** study for a test, **I** start several days early.\"\n- **Also Right**: \"When **you** study for a test, **you** should start several days early.\"\n\n**Example 2: You → One Shift**\n- **Wrong**: \"If **you** want to succeed, **one** must work hard.\"\n  - Problem: Shifts from second person (you) to third person (one)\n- **Right**: \"If **you** want to succeed, **you** must work hard.\"\n\n**Example 3: One → They Shift**\n- **Wrong**: \"When **one** reads carefully, **they** understand better.\"\n  - Problem: Shifts from third singular (one) to third plural (they)\n- **Right**: \"When **one** reads carefully, **one** understands better.\"\n- **Better**: \"When **people** read carefully, **they** understand better.\"\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: Misplaced Modifiers**\n\nA modifier is a word or phrase that describes something. It must be placed next to what it modifies!\n\n**The Rule**: Place modifiers as close as possible to what they describe.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Wrong**: \"I saw a dog **wearing a hat** walking down the street.\"\n  - Problem: Was the hat walking down the street?\n- **Right**: \"**While walking down the street**, I saw a dog wearing a hat.\"\n- **Also Right**: \"I saw a dog wearing a hat **while I was walking down the street**.\"\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Wrong**: \"The teacher gave the test to the students **that was very difficult**.\"\n  - Problem: Were the students difficult?\n- **Right**: \"The teacher gave **the test that was very difficult** to the students.\"\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Wrong**: \"We saw the mountain **driving down the highway**.\"\n  - Problem: Was the mountain driving?\n- **Right**: \"**While driving down the highway**, we saw the mountain.\"\n\n**Example 4:**\n- **Wrong**: \"She served sandwiches to the children **on paper plates**.\"\n  - Problem: Were the children on paper plates?\n- **Right**: \"She served sandwiches **on paper plates** to the children.\"\n\n**Tip to Avoid Misplaced Modifiers:**\nAsk yourself: \"What is this phrase describing?\" Then place it next to that word!",

+ - Identifying parts of speech in context
+ - 3 practice questions
+ 
+ ### **Chapter 2: Sentence Structure** (Original - Maintained)
+ - Simple and Compound Sentences

+ - 3 practice questions
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 🌟 NEW CHAPTERS - California Grade 6 Standards
+ 
+ ### **Chapter 3: Mastering Pronouns - Part 1** ⭐ NEW
+ **Focus: Pronoun Case (Most Important Grammar Goal for Grade 6!)**
+ 
+ **Content Covered:**
+ 1. **Subjective Case** (I, he, she, we, they)
+    - Used when pronoun is doing the action
+    
+ 2. **Objective Case** (me, him, her, us, them)
+    - Used when pronoun is receiving the action
+    - Always used after prepositions (to, for, with, between)
+ 
+ 3. **Possessive Case** (my, mine, his, her, hers, our, ours, their, theirs, its)
+    - Shows ownership
+ 
+ **Key Strategies Taught:**
+ - ✅ **"Remove the other person" trick** for compound subjects/objects
+   - "John and I went" → Remove "John and" → "I went" ✓
+   - "Between you and me" → Remove "you and" → "Between me" ✓
+ - ✅ Common trouble spots: Compound subjects, prepositions
+ - ✅ After prepositions, ALWAYS use objective case
+ 
+ **Practice Questions: 6**
+ - Compound subjects (I vs. me)
+ - After prepositions (between you and I/me)
+ - Possessive pronouns (mine vs. my)
+ 
+ **California Standard**: L.6.1.a - Ensure pronouns are in proper case
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### **Chapter 4: Mastering Pronouns - Part 2** ⭐ NEW
+ **Focus: Intensive Pronouns and Clear Antecedents**
+ 
+ **Content Covered:**
+ 
+ **1. Intensive Pronouns (Adding Emphasis)**
+ - Forms: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves
+ - Purpose: Add emphasis to who did something
+ - Examples:
+   - "I did the homework **myself**." (emphasizes I did it personally)
+   - "The principal **herself** made the announcement."
+ 
+ **Common Mistakes:**
+ - ❌ "Myself and Tom went to the game." 
+ - ✓ "Tom and I went to the game."
+ - Rule: DON'T use intensive pronouns as subjects!
+ 
+ **2. Clear Antecedents (Avoiding Vague Pronouns)**
+ - Every pronoun must clearly refer to ONE specific noun
+ - ❌ "Sarah and Jane went shopping, and **she** bought a dress." (Who is she?)
+ - ✓ "Sarah and Jane went shopping, and **Sarah** bought a dress."
+ 
+ **Vague Pronoun Types:**
+ - Unclear "she/he/it"
+ - Vague "they" (In the article, they say...)
+ - Ambiguous "it"
+ 
+ **Rules Taught:**
+ 1. Make sure every pronoun clearly refers to ONE noun

+ 
+ ### **Chapter 5: Punctuation for Clarity** ⭐ NEW
+ **Focus: Parenthetical Elements and Coordinate Adjectives**
+ 
+ **Content Covered:**
+ 
+ **1. Parenthetical Elements (Non-Essential Information)**
+ Set off extra information with commas, parentheses, or dashes:
+ 
+ **A. Commas** (most common):
+ - The principal**, Mr. Smith,** gave a speech.
+ - My teacher**, who has taught for 20 years,** is experienced.
+ 
+ **B. Parentheses** (very extra info):
+ - The test **(which covers chapters 1-5)** is on Friday.
+ 
+ **C. Dashes** (emphasis):
+ - The winner**—my best friend—**was announced.
+ 
+ **Test**: Remove the parenthetical element - does the sentence still work? If yes, it's non-essential!
+ 
+ **2. Coordinate Adjectives**
+ Adjectives that equally describe the same noun need commas.
+ 
+ **The Two Tests:**
+ 1. Can you put "and" between them?
+ 2. Can you reverse the order?
+ 
+ If YES to both → Use comma!
+ 
+ **Examples:**
+ - ✓ It was a long**, **exhausting day. (long and exhausting ✓ | exhausting, long ✓)
+ - ✗ She bought a small red car. (small and red car? awkward - NO comma)
+ 
+ **Practice Questions: 6**
+ - Punctuating appositives
+ - Comma usage with non-essential clauses
+ - Identifying coordinate adjectives
+ - Choosing commas, parentheses, or dashes
+ 
+ **California Standard**: L.6.2.a - Use punctuation (commas, parentheses, dashes) to set off nonrestrictive/parenthetical elements

+ ### **Chapter 6: Sentence Variety and Style** ⭐ NEW
+ **Focus: Simple, Compound, and Complex Sentences**
+ 
+ **Content Covered:**
+ 
+ **1. Simple Sentence**
+ - One independent clause
+ - Example: The dog barked.
+ 
+ **2. Compound Sentence**
+ - Two independent clauses joined by FANBOYS + comma
+ - Structure: Independent, **FANBOYS** Independent
+ - Example: I studied hard**, yet** I felt nervous.
+ - **Key Rule**: Comma BEFORE the conjunction!
+ 
+ **3. Complex Sentence**
+ - Independent clause + dependent clause
+ - Dependent clause starts with subordinating conjunction
+ 
+ **Subordinating Conjunctions:**
+ - Time: when, while, before, after, until, since
+ - Cause: because, since, as
+ - Condition: if, unless, whether
+ - Contrast: although, though, even though, while
+ 
+ **Punctuation Rules:**
+ - Dependent clause FIRST → use comma
+   - **When** I finish homework**, **I'll watch TV.
+ - Independent clause FIRST → usually no comma
+   - I'll watch TV **when** I finish homework.
+ 
+ **Why Vary Sentences?**
+ 1. Avoid choppy writing
+ 2. Show relationships between ideas
+ 3. Create rhythm and interest
+ 
+ **Practice Questions: 6**
+ - Identifying sentence types
+ - Correct punctuation for compound sentences
+ - Correct punctuation for complex sentences

+ - Second: you, your (the person spoken to)
+ - Third: he, she, it, they, one (person/thing spoken about)
+ 
+ **The Rule**: DON'T SWITCH PERSONS!
+ 
+ **Common Errors:**
+ - ❌ "When **I** study, **you** should start early." (I → you shift)
+ - ✓ "When **I** study, **I** start early."
+ 
+ - ❌ "If **you** want to succeed, **one** must work hard." (you → one shift)
+ - ✓ "If **you** want to succeed, **you** must work hard."
+ 
+ **2. Misplaced Modifiers**
+ 
+ **The Rule**: Place descriptive phrases next to what they describe!
+ 
+ **Common Errors:**
+ - ❌ "I saw a dog **wearing a hat** walking down the street." (Was the hat walking?)
+ - ✓ "**While walking down the street**, I saw a dog wearing a hat."
+

+ - ✓ "**While driving down the highway**, we saw the mountain."
+ 
+ - ❌ "She served sandwiches to the children **on paper plates**." (Were children on plates?)
