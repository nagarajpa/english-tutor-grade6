## 🌟 NEW CHAPTERS - California Grade 6 Standards

### **Chapter 3: Mastering Pronouns - Part 1** ⭐ NEW
**Focus: Pronoun Case (Most Important Grammar Goal for Grade 6!)**

**Content Covered:**
1. **Subjective Case** (I, he, she, we, they)
   - Used when pronoun is doing the action
   
2. **Objective Case** (me, him, her, us, them)
   - Used when pronoun is receiving the action
   - Always used after prepositions (to, for, with, between)

3. **Possessive Case** (my, mine, his, her, hers, our, ours, their, theirs, its)
   - Shows ownership

**Key Strategies Taught:**
- ✅ **"Remove the other person" trick** for compound subjects/objects
  - "John and I went" → Remove "John and" → "I went" ✓
  - "Between you and me" → Remove "you and" → "Between me" ✓
- ✅ Common trouble spots: Compound subjects, prepositions
- ✅ After prepositions, ALWAYS use objective case

**Practice Questions: 6**
- Compound subjects (I vs. me)
- After prepositions (between you and I/me)
- Possessive pronouns (mine vs. my)

**California Standard**: L.6.1.a - Ensure pronouns are in proper case

---

### **Chapter 4: Mastering Pronouns - Part 2** ⭐ NEW
**Focus: Intensive Pronouns and Clear Antecedents**

**Content Covered:**

**1. Intensive Pronouns (Adding Emphasis)**
- Forms: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves
- Purpose: Add emphasis to who did something
- Examples:
  - "I did the homework **myself**." (emphasizes I did it personally)
  - "The principal **herself** made the announcement."

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ "Myself and Tom went to the game." 
- ✓ "Tom and I went to the game."
- Rule: DON'T use intensive pronouns as subjects!

**2. Clear Antecedents (Avoiding Vague Pronouns)**
- Every pronoun must clearly refer to ONE specific noun
- ❌ "Sarah and Jane went shopping, and **she** bought a dress." (Who is she?)
- ✓ "Sarah and Jane went shopping, and **Sarah** bought a dress."

**Vague Pronoun Types:**
- Unclear "she/he/it"
- Vague "they" (In the article, they say...)
- Ambiguous "it"

**Rules Taught:**
1. Make sure every pronoun clearly refers to ONE noun
2. When in doubt, repeat the noun
3. Place pronouns close to their antecedents
4. Avoid using "they" without a clear antecedent

**Practice Questions: 5**
- Intensive pronoun usage
- Identifying vague pronouns
- Fixing unclear antecedents

**California Standard**: L.6.1 - Recognize and correct vague pronouns

---

### **Chapter 5: Punctuation for Clarity** ⭐ NEW
**Focus: Parenthetical Elements and Coordinate Adjectives**

**Content Covered:**

**1. Parenthetical Elements (Non-Essential Information)**
Set off extra information with commas, parentheses, or dashes:

**A. Commas** (most common):
- The principal**, Mr. Smith,** gave a speech.
- My teacher**, who has taught for 20 years,** is experienced.

**B. Parentheses** (very extra info):
- The test **(which covers chapters 1-5)** is on Friday.

**C. Dashes** (emphasis):
- The winner**—my best friend—**was announced.

**Test**: Remove the parenthetical element - does the sentence still work? If yes, it's non-essential!

**2. Coordinate Adjectives**
Adjectives that equally describe the same noun need commas.

**The Two Tests:**
1. Can you put "and" between them?
2. Can you reverse the order?

If YES to both → Use comma!

**Examples:**
- ✓ It was a long**, **exhausting day. (long and exhausting ✓ | exhausting, long ✓)
- ✗ She bought a small red car. (small and red car? awkward - NO comma)

**Practice Questions: 6**
- Punctuating appositives
- Comma usage with non-essential clauses
- Identifying coordinate adjectives
- Choosing commas, parentheses, or dashes

**California Standard**: L.6.2.a - Use punctuation (commas, parentheses, dashes) to set off nonrestrictive/parenthetical elements

---

### **Chapter 6: Sentence Variety and Style** ⭐ NEW
**Focus: Simple, Compound, and Complex Sentences**

**Content Covered:**

**1. Simple Sentence**
- One independent clause
- Example: The dog barked.

**2. Compound Sentence**
- Two independent clauses joined by FANBOYS + comma
- Structure: Independent, **FANBOYS** Independent
- Example: I studied hard**, yet** I felt nervous.
- **Key Rule**: Comma BEFORE the conjunction!

**3. Complex Sentence**
- Independent clause + dependent clause
- Dependent clause starts with subordinating conjunction

**Subordinating Conjunctions:**
- Time: when, while, before, after, until, since
- Cause: because, since, as
- Condition: if, unless, whether
- Contrast: although, though, even though, while

**Punctuation Rules:**
- Dependent clause FIRST → use comma
  - **When** I finish homework**, **I'll watch TV.
- Independent clause FIRST → usually no comma
  - I'll watch TV **when** I finish homework.

**Why Vary Sentences?**
1. Avoid choppy writing
2. Show relationships between ideas
3. Create rhythm and interest

**Practice Questions: 6**
- Identifying sentence types
- Correct punctuation for compound sentences
- Correct punctuation for complex sentences
- Creating sentence variety

**California Standard**: L.6.3.a - Vary sentence patterns for meaning, reader interest, and style

---

### **Chapter 7: Avoiding Common Errors** ⭐ NEW
**Focus: Pronoun Shifts and Misplaced Modifiers**

**Content Covered:**

**1. Pronoun Shifts (Consistency Errors)**

**Types of Person:**
- First: I, we, me, us (the speaker)
- Second: you, your (the person spoken to)
- Third: he, she, it, they, one (person/thing spoken about)

**The Rule**: DON'T SWITCH PERSONS!

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ "When **I** study, **you** should start early." (I → you shift)
- ✓ "When **I** study, **I** start early."

- ❌ "If **you** want to succeed, **one** must work hard." (you → one shift)
- ✓ "If **you** want to succeed, **you** must work hard."

**2. Misplaced Modifiers**

**The Rule**: Place descriptive phrases next to what they describe!

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ "I saw a dog **wearing a hat** walking down the street." (Was the hat walking?)
- ✓ "**While walking down the street**, I saw a dog wearing a hat."

- ❌ "We saw the mountain **driving down the highway**." (Was the mountain driving?)
- ✓ "**While driving down the highway**, we saw the mountain."

- ❌ "She served sandwiches to the children **on paper plates**." (Were children on plates?)
- ✓ "She served sandwiches **on paper plates** to the children."

**Strategy**: Ask "What is this phrase describing?" Then place it next to that word!

**Practice Questions: 6**
- Identifying pronoun shifts
- Correcting pronoun consistency
- Fixing misplaced modifiers
- Identifying correctly placed modifiers

**California Standard**: L.6.1 - Demonstrate command of conventions of standard English
